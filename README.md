### Non-stationary analysis of groundwater irrigation behavior

1.	**Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC)**:Temporal Clustering of agents’ irrigation behavior. Code: https://github.com/FlorentF9/DeepTemporalClustering

2.	**adfTest4Agents.py**: Evaluates the non-stationarity of agents’ irrigation behavior using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.

3.	**getInfluentialVariables4Agents.py**: Identifies the variables that can have a statistically causal influence on the decision-making of annual groundwater irrigation using Directed Information.

4.	**predictIrrigation4Agents.py**: Predicts agents’ monthly groundwater irrigation depth for non-stationary agents by two XGBoost models, Model1 and Model2. 

5.	**counterAnalysis4Agents.py**: Displays the results of counterfactual analysis in terms of groundwater use (m) and relative groundwater level (m).

For datasets required to run the scripts, please find them in the **data.zip**.
